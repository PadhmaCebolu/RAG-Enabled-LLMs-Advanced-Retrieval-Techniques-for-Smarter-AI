They also intend to pay a cash dividend on a quarterly basis going forward.\n\nQ13: stion 13: What risks did Meta highlight for 2024?\nA: Meta highlighted risks for 2024 such as competition, government actions that could restrict access to their products or impair their ability to sell advertising in certain countries, privacy concerns, security breaches, managing their scale and geographically-dispersed operations, and market conditions affecting the payment of dividends.\n\nQ14: stion 14: What drove Meta’s revenue growth in Q4 2023?\nA: Meta's revenue growth in Q4 2023 was primarily driven by a 25% increase in revenue compared to the same period in 2022. This growth can be attributed to the continued growth of their community and business, as mentioned by Mark Zuckerberg, Meta's founder and CEO. Additionally, progress made in advancing AI and the metaverse likely contributed to attracting more users and advertisers, ultimately leading to higher revenue for the company.\n\nQ15: stion 15: How did Reality Labs perform throughout 2023, and what’s Meta’s plan for 2024?\nA: Based on Meta's Q4 2023 financial report, Reality Labs experienced operating losses that increased meaningfully year-over-year due to ongoing product development efforts in augmented reality/virtual reality and investments to further scale the ecosystem. For 2024, Meta plans to continue investing in Reality Labs, expecting the operating losses to increase further as they focus on product development in augmented reality/virtual reality. Additionally, Meta anticipates capital expenditures for 2024 to be in the range of 30-37 billion, with growth being driven by investments in servers, AI and non-AI hardware, and data centers. The company also expects to shift its workforce composition towards higher-cost technical roles to support priority areas in 2024.\n\nImproved ROUGE scores: {'rouge1': 0.38962602045022343, 'rouge2': 0.255639873138951, 'rougeL': 0.35369680116819724, 'rougeLsum': 0.35525737334120594}\n",
